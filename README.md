## A Study Guide for Prework

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I needed a webpage for notes taken during the bootcamp. I needed organized sections to display notes for HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. This webpage will also serve as a tracker for what I have learned.

I built this webpage so that I have a single point of reference for notes I have taken during this bootcamp.

Not only does this webpage organize my notes my topic, but it also has a feature in the console that helps me choose which topic to study first.

I learned how to use HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. I learned how to create branches and push new features. I also learned how to deploy the webpage.
